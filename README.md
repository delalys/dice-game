# Dice game

I've developed this application to learn Javascript.

[=> DEMO](https://dice-game-y.herokuapp.com/)

It is entirely in plain Javascript. I have developed it after 3 weeks of studying.

It represents the state of my skills at that moment, have a look at its code and don't hesitate to compare it to other projects to see my progress! Here is what it is made out of:

**Its features:**

* Visually rolls up to 9 Dices with "real" random positionning on board.
* Dices can be put on the side when clicked
* Counts the number of rolls, sum of dices on board and those put aside.
* A game UI that adapts to its live data
* Full CSS customazibale Dices
